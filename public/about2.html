<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Swapnil Dixit, an aspiring web developer currently learning HTML. I have completed a few basic projects and am eager to expand my knowledge in web development. I'm passionate about creating clean, user-friendly websites and excited to dive deeper into more advanced technologies.

    When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new skills, learning about technology, and working on personal projects to improve my development abilities. I'm always open to new opportunities to grow and collaborate!
    </p>
<p>In addition to my work with HTML, I am actively exploring other areas of web development and programming, including CSS and JavaScript. I believe that continuous learning is key to staying current in this ever-evolving field, and I am committed to expanding my skill set through hands-on projects and coursework.

<p>Feel free to connect with me as I continue my journey in web development.</p>
